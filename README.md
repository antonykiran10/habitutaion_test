Overview:
---------

The code is a set of functions designed for fish detection and tracking in images. It primarily focuses on finding the centroid of a fish, locating its head, and predicting the fish's movement over subsequent frames.

1\. `find_centroid` Function:
-----------------------------

### Purpose:

This function is responsible for finding the centroid of a fish in a given grayscale image based on the average position of the brightest points.

### Parameters:

*   `input_path`: String, path to the input image.
*   `cutoff`: Integer, a threshold to filter out low-intensity pixels.

### Returns:

A tuple representing the average x and y coordinates of the fish centroid. If no fish is found, the function returns the tuple ('no\_fish', 'no\_fish').

2\. `head_finder` Function:
---------------------------

### Purpose:

This function determines the position of the fish's head within a specified radius around the centroid.

### Parameters:

*   `cx`: x-coordinate of the fish centroid.
*   `cy`: y-coordinate of the fish centroid.
*   `radius`: Integer, the radius around the centroid to search for the fish head.
*   `image`: NumPy array representing the image.

### Returns:

A tuple with the x and y coordinates of the fish's head. If no fish is found, it returns the tuple ('no\_fish', 'no\_fish').

3\. `fish_hunter` Function:
---------------------------

### Purpose:

This function predicts the movement of the fish by iteratively applying a hunting algorithm.

### Parameters:

*   `radius`: Integer, the radius used in the hunting algorithm.
*   `theta`: Integer, an angle parameter used in the hunting algorithm.
*   `input_path`: String, path to the input image.
*   `head_x`, `head_y`: x and y coordinates of the fish's head.
*   `centroid_x`, `centroid_y`: x and y coordinates of the fish's centroid.

### Returns:

Two lists, `points_x` and `points_y`, representing the predicted trajectory points of the fish. The trajectory is predicted for 15 steps into the future.

4\. `hunter` Function:
----------------------

### Purpose:

This function is the core of the hunting algorithm, which predicts the next position of the fish based on its previous position.

### Parameters:

*   `radius`: Integer, the radius used in the hunting algorithm.
*   `theta`: Integer, an angle parameter used in the hunting algorithm.
*   `input_path`: String, path to the input image.
*   `p1_x`, `p1_y`: x and y coordinates of the previous point.
*   `p2_x`, `p2_y`: x and y coordinates of the current point.

### Returns:

A tuple with the x and y coordinates of the predicted next position of the fish. If no fish is found, it returns the tuple ('no\_fish', 'no\_fish').

Important Notes:
----------------

*   The code relies on the OpenCV and NumPy libraries for image processing and manipulation.
*   The PIL library is used for converting the image array to a PIL image for further processing.
*   Some commented-out code and print statements are present, possibly used for debugging. Adjustments or removal may be needed based on specific use cases.
